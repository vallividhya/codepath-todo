Submitted by: Valli Vidhya Venkatesan

Time spent: 4.5 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can **successfully add and remove items** from the todo list
* [x] User can **tap a todo item in the list and bring up an edit screen for the todo item** and then have any changes to the text reflected in the todo list.
* [x] User can **persist todo items** and retrieve them properly on app restart

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Persist the todo items [into SQLite](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Persisting-Data-to-the-Device#sqlite) instead of a text file 
* [ ] Improve style of the todo items in the list [using a custom adapter](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-an-ArrayAdapter-with-ListView)
* [ ] Add support for completion due dates for todo items (and display within listview item)
* [ ] Use a [DialogFragment](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-DialogFragment) instead of new Activity for editing items
* [ ] Add support for selecting the priority of each todo item (and display in listview item)
* [ ] Tweak the style improving the UI / UX, play with colors, images or backgrounds

## Project Analysis

As part of your pre-work submission, please reflect on the app and answer the following questions below:

**Question 1:** "What are your reactions to the Android app development platform so far? Compare and contrast Android's approach to layouts and user interfaces in past platforms you've used."

**Answer:** Over the years, the setting up of the environment and running the app on an emulator have become faster and easier. This is my first experience in using Android Studio for Android development and it looks like a fully integrated development environment. 

**Question 2:** "Take a moment to reflect on the `ArrayAdapter` used in your pre-work. How would you describe an adapter in this context and what is its function in Android? Why do you think the adapter is important? Explain the purpose of the `convertView` in the `getView` method of the `ArrayAdapter`."

**Answer:** An arrayadapter bridges the user interface components and the data source. The adapter is responsible for providing a view for each item in the data set. It listens to changes in the datasets and reflects them in the user interface.  
    The adapter plays an important role in the performace and scalability of the listviews, by reusing row views. The getView() method gets any reusable views, if possible. The convertView parameter could be null or could contain a reusuable view. If it is null, the adapter inflates a new view from the XML file. If not null, the convertView contains the reference to the reusable view and eliminates the need to create a new view.
